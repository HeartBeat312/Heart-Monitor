This open source heart rate monitor. I wanted a cheap way to log and graph my exercise data. Professional (and expensive) modules exists, but didn’t give me the raw control and data I wanted. This project was inspired by humanapi.org and the maker philosophy (adafruit). Go open source hardware and software.

If I were to restart this project today (already owning an Android w/Bluetooth and GPS), I believe that I would just get a Polar WearLink®+ transmitter with Bluetooth® and log my information with Android.
